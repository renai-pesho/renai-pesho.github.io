        <h2>Senior in Easley, South Carolina</h2>
        
         <p>I am a senior at Bob Jones University studying Interior Architecture and Design. I play society volleyball, soccer, and softball. I work Panageries, an interior design firm in Greenvills.</p>
         <p>
            I enjoy participating in society outreaches, where we help faculty members. I currently go to church at Summit Church in Easley. I help teach the Elementary youth during Sunday services.

         <p>
            I also enjoy doing crafts and do it yourself projects whenever I have free time. Since, interior design is my major, I love fixing up my home for each season. So, I make new things for my home all the time.
